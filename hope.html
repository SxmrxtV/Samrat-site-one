            <p class="blog-text">Hope is a very weird concept and when personified, is a very fickle being, moving here and there, hiding in plain site, running towards the smallest and the most insignificant things in your life . She is quite the timid being too, she won't always come to you when you try to approach it. She only comes to you when you are ready for her. Hope, is immortal, ever persistent, never dying, never extinguishing her light, only her fuel changes every now and then. She can hide in the darkest of the corners, but if you're ready and looking hard enough, it will illuminate your world with her brilliance more than that of the infinitely many stars in the cosmos, she'll make you comfortable and safe with her warmth gentler than any flame on earth. </p>
